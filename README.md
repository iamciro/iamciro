# ðŸ‘‹ Hey!

What's up? Iâ€™m Ciro! Very happy to see you here

I'm very passionate about technology, characterized by curiosity and determination to solve problems.

I'm a Javascript and Python developer. I have experience in React, React Native and Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Selenium, Web scraping, etc).

I love the FOSS community and the amazing tools created! So I also try to give my small but significant (I hope) contributions!
